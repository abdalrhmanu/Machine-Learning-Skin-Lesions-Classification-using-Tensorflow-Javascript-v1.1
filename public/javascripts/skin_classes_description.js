    0: 'Melanocytic nevi are benign neoplasms of melanocytes and appear in a myriad of variants, which all are included in our series. The variants may differ signiﬁcantly from a dermatoscopic point of view.',

    1: 'Basal cell carcinoma is a common variant of epithelial skin cancer that rarely metastasizes but grows destructively if untreated. It appears in different morphologic variants (ﬂat, nodular, pigmented, cystic, etc).',

    2: 'Benign keratosis is a generic class that includes seborrheic ker- atoses ("senile wart"), solar lentigo - which can be regarded a ﬂat variant of seborrheic keratosis - and lichen-planus like keratoses (LPLK), which corresponds to a seborrheic keratosis or a solar lentigo with inﬂammation and regression. The three subgroups may look different dermatoscop- ically, but we grouped them together because they are similar biologically and often reported under the same generic term histopathologically. From a dermatoscopic view, lichen planus-like keratoses are especially challeng- ing because they can show morphologic features mimicking melanoma and are often biopsied or excised for diagnostic reasons.',

    3: 'Dermatoﬁbroma is a benign skin lesion regarded as either a benign proliferation or an inﬂammatory reaction to minimal trauma. It is brown often showing a central zone of ﬁbrosis dermatoscopically.',

    4: 'Melanoma is a malignant neoplasm derived from melanocytes that may appear in different variants. If excised in an early stage it can be cured by simple surgical excision. Melanomas can be invasive or noninvasive (in situ). We included all variants of melanoma including melanoma in situ, but did exclude nonpigmented, subungual, ocular or mucosal melanoma.',

    5: 'Melanocytic nevi are benign neoplasms of melanocytes and appear in a myriad of variants, which all are included in our series. The variants may differ signiﬁcantly from a dermatoscopic point of view.',

    6: 'Vascular skin lesions in the dataset range from cherry angiomas to angiokeratomas and pyogenic granulomas. Hemorrhage is also included in this category.'
